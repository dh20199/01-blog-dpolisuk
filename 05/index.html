                <p> Pierre Elliott Trudeau was Prime Minister of Canada from 1968-79 and 1980-1984. His major accomplishments include the 1969 Official Languages Act, which officially made Canada bilingual, and the 1982 Constitution Act, which “repatriated” Canada’s constitution and included the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. As well, in 1971, he declared multiculturalism to be official policy of Canada and later enshrined it into the Charter. He also intervened in the 1980 Quebec Referendum in favour of Canadian unity. Furthermore, the 1976 Immigration Act radically changed Canadian immigration policy to be non-discriminatory, assist refugees, and generally help immigrants adapt to life in Canada.

                    Trudeau is an interesting historical figure for me because I was born and grew up in the Canada he envisioned. My maternal grandparents moved to Toronto from the Soviet Union in the 1970s as the result of Trudeau’s immigration policies and because of this and his multiculturalism policy, I grew up in one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the world.

                    Regardless if one supported Trudeau’s policies, it is difficult to disagree that he was an influential Prime Minister and that his tenure in office was a turning point in Canadian history that turned a conservative country into a progressive one.
